# torn-shirt-classifier-mini
Classify between torn shirt and normal shirt

## Introduction
Model classify whether a given image is of torn shirt or not torn shirt.<br/>
Total <b>Less than 50</b> images (27 for training, to be specific) are used for getting around 75% accuracy.<br/>
Which is better than random guassing.

## Dependancy
- Python
- Numpy
- Keras
- Tensorflow

## Future improvements
More data can be gathered and results can be improved.<br/>
Different base models can be tried like Inception. But I think, accuracy will be more oe less same.<br/>
Also, I have only trained on 10 epochs. But incresing epochs will improve accuracy a bit.
